# GraphQL Project

A GraphQL API using C#, EntityFramework and HotChocolate.

## Prerequisites

You'll need :
- Visual Studio 2022 (with "ASP.NET and web development" kit)
- DotNET 7 (download the SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0))
- SqlExpress (Or any kind of way to get SqlServer. You'll need to chage the connection string in Program.cs if it's not SQLExpress)

You can also have a database viewer like SSMS in order to have a direct view of the tables.

## How to begin

Open the solution (.sln file) using Visual Studio. In case there are compiler errors showing up, you might need to get the NuGet packages; right-click the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages".

In the Package Manager Console, execute the command `Update-Database`. This will create the database using the migration file. If the migration file is missing/out of date, execute the command `Add-Migration` beforehand.

## How to use

Build and execute the code. A web page should. Add to the URL `graphql`. You will be able to test the API using this page.
You'll need to manually feed the databse by yourself for now.
